Portfolio Website

This is a basic, two-page portfolio website created using HTML and CSS. Designed to introduce myself and provide contact information, this site serves as an online profile showcasing foundational web development skills.

## Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the website’s content, including sections, navigation, and elements.
CSS: For visual styling, including layout design, typography, and color schemes.
The decision to use HTML and CSS exclusively allows the site to remain lightweight and fast, ensuring a seamless browsing experience while focusing on the essentials of front-end development.

## Website Structure

The website is made up of two main pages:

Home Page: This is the main landing page that provides a brief overview of my background, skills, and interests. It’s designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that the content is clear and easy to navigate.

Contact Page: This page offers a way for visitors to connect with me. It includes links to my social media profiles and email, making it easy to reach out for networking, collaborations, or professional inquiries.

## Purpose and Design Approach

The primary goal of this project is to create a functional and visually clean personal website using core web development languages. By focusing on HTML for structure and CSS for styling, the site demonstrates the importance of simplicity and readability in design. The clean layout reflects my approach to web development, with an emphasis on functionality, usability, and basic design principles.
